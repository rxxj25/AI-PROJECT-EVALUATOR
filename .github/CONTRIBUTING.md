# Contributing to the NatWest Hack4aCause

The NatWest Hack4aCause projects and associated repositiories under FINOS and FINOS Labs are [Apache 2.0 licensed](LICENSE) and accept contributions via git pull requests. Each commit must include a DCO line in the git commit message:

`Signed-off-by: GitHub User Name <your.email@example.com>`

This sign-off means you agree the commit satisfies the

## Contributing Pull Requests (Code & Docs)

To make review of PRs easier, please:

- Please make sure your PRs will merge cleanly (all conflicts resolved) - PRs that don't are unlikely to be accepted.
- For code contributions, follow the existing code layout.
- For documentation contributions, follow the general structure, language, and tone of the [NatWest Hack4aCause 2025](https://github.com/finos-labs/learnaix-h-2025).
- Keep commits small and cohesive - if you have multiple contributions, please submit them as independent commits (and ideally as independent PRs too).
- Reference issues if your PR has anything to do with an issue (even if it doesn't address it). You can do so by [linking your PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) or [referencing the issue in a comment](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests).
- Minimise non-functional changes (e.g. whitespace).
- Ensure all new files include a header comment block containing the [Apache License v2.0 and your copyright information](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#apply).
- If necessary (e.g. due to 3rd party dependency licensing requirements), update the [NOTICE file](https://github.com/finos/learnaix-h-2025/blob/master/NOTICE) with any new attribution or other notices

- **Reference issues, wiki pages, and pull requests liberally!**
